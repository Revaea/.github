## Welcome!

 Revaea is a grand narrative, but its descriptions will be fragmented.

 What do you hope Revaea to be—an idea, a person, an organization, a world, or something else?

 Hmph, since you're asking, I won't just explain it so easily! Revaea, of course, is a profound concept. It could be a philosophical system, maybe a set of values that guides an entire society, or perhaps even an organization far more complex than you can imagine. 
 
 In short, Revaea isn't something easily defined. It can represent personal ambition, but it can also symbolize a force that transcends the individual.

 Under the influence of Revaea, people must uphold their personal honor while always being accountable to the collective.

 Sounds difficult, doesn't it? That's the beauty of it. No one can reach the pinnacle alone, but if you only focus on others, you're wasting your own potential. 

 The real power of Revaea lies in harmonizing everyone without sacrificing individual growth. Want to know more? Hmph, think it over yourself; I’m not going to tell you everything!

## About WentUrc

​WentUrc is the name of the old world. It was born from chaos, infused with the remnants of primal dreams. However, because it was devoid of meaning, the Gods lost interest and subsequently abandoned it.  
​Nevertheless, there is no need for despair. A new order shall rise to replace the chaos of the old world. This is the very origin of **Revaea**.
