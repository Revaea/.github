Hmph... You even want **This Princess** to prepare the introduction for you? You really are greedy!   
B-But... w-well, since it's for **Revaea**, I suppose I can get a little serious about it.   
Here you go, meow. You'd better read it carefully—don't let my hard work go to waste!   

## Welcome!

*(I-it’s not like I’m welcoming you or anything!)*  

**Revaea** is a grand narrative, but it never reveals itself all at once.  
Its descriptions are fragmented, scattered like pieces of a dream—  
and precisely because of that, it invites you to keep searching.  

So you ask:  
What is **Revaea**?  
An idea? A person? An organization? A world?  

Hmph. That question already proves how little you understand.  
**Revaea is something that resists easy definition.**  

If I *have* to explain it:  
It can be a philosophical framework,  
a system of values that sustains an entire society.  
It could also be an organization so intricate that no single person can fully grasp it.  
Or perhaps… a force that transcends the individual altogether.  

Under the influence of **Revaea**,  
each person must uphold their own honor,  
while remaining accountable to the collective as a whole.  

Sounds difficult, doesn’t it?  
Hmph—of course it does. That’s exactly the point.  

No one can reach the pinnacle alone.  
But if you focus only on others, you end up wasting your own potential.  

**The true power of Revaea** lies in this:  
harmonizing everyone together  
without sacrificing individual growth.  

Want to know more?  
Don’t get ahead of yourself.  
I’m not telling you everything that easily—think it through on your own!  


## Detail

*(Listen carefully. I won’t repeat myself.)*  

This is a **fictional world**.  
Every user within it is a character of that world—  

—with the exception of those who bear a code name after **IGCrystal** and **Larch-C**.  

Some characters possess self-narrative documents,  
containing short stories that belong solely to them.  

*Created by Larch-C.*

## About WentUrc  

*(The old world… don’t think I forgot about it.)*  

WentUrc is the name of the old world.  
It was born from chaos and infused with the remnants of primal dreams.  

However, because it lacked meaning,  
the Gods lost interest  
and ultimately abandoned it.  

But—there is no need for despair.  

Chaos will not last forever.  
A new order is destined to rise in its place.  

**This is the very origin of Revaea.**  

…  

Hmph. I’ve said more than enough.  
If you can truly understand all this—  
then maybe, just maybe,  
you’re not as hopeless as you look, nya ~
